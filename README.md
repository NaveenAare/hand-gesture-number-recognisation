# hand-gesture-number-recognisation
detects the gesture numbers using opencv


The Main Steps involved in the number detection are:-

           1)Background Substraction(Removes the old frame from the new frame conataing the hand)
           2)Thresholding(Makes the all the background black expect the hand region)
           3)counter extraction(getting the out line or boundary around a largest area in theframe and considering it as a hand)
          
         
#Step-1:


  import all the libraries required and substarct the background from the new frame
  
  
  
#step-2:


  To segment the region of hand in the image
      
      
#step-3:


  To count the number of fingers in the segmented hand region
 
 
 #out-put
